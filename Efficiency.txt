I manually measured the time taken for the dashboard to update where the tracker is located. 
I found the average time taken to be 3.5 Â± 0.5 seconds. 
The efficiency seemed to be independent of which room the tracker was moved to/from, which would be expected 
since the tracker location is just based on a comparison between the last received RSSI value from each beacon. 

This is a fairly long delay, especially considering that the rooms share boundaries so an instant change in 
location/room is a likely and frequent occurrence. 
The main cause of this delay is the time it takes to scan for all available Bluetooth devices. 
To circumvent this, some sort of interrupt/break could be implemented wherein once the tag is found as an 
available device, the search stops and then restarts looking for the tag again. 
This would then only cause a delay from having to find the specific tag which should be significantly less 
than what it is currently (although it depends on where in the list the device is found).
